    This is required because Ledger does not appear to be able to grok a
    transaction like this one:

      2014-11-02 * "Buy some stock with foreign currency funds"
        Assets:CA:Investment:HOOL          5 HOOL {520.0 USD}

        Assets:CA:Investment:Cash   -2939.46 CAD @ 0.8879 USD

    HISTORICAL NOTE: Adding a price directive on the first posting above makes
    Ledger accept the transaction. So we will not split the transaction here
    now. However, since Ledger's treatment of this type of conflict is subject
    to revision (See http://bugs.ledger-cli.org/show_bug.cgi?id=630), we will
    keep this code around, it might become useful eventually. See
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ledger-cli/35hA0Dvhom0/WX8gY_5kHy0J for
    details of the discussion.

      entry: An instance of Transaction.

        converted: boolean, true if a conversion was made.
